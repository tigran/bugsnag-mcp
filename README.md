## 🔑 Obtaining a Bugsnag API Key

To use this MCP server, you'll need a Bugsnag API key:

1. Log in to your Bugsnag account at [https://app.bugsnag.com/](https://app.bugsnag.com/)
2. Go to **Settings** > **Organization settings** > **Access tokens**
3. Create a new personal access token with the following permissions:
   - Read projects
   - Read and write errors
   - Read and write comments
4. Copy the generated token for use with the MCP server
